title: Experiences with Bloc
---

I started Bloc on July 4th with high expectations. My goal was very clear . I wanted to start a carreer in web development. 
Now, nearly two months later I'm on the right track but there is still so much work to do! Having about four months left into this program I realized for sure, it won't be done. Not even by the end of the year. It is never done. I will never stop learning. This industry is so freaking exciting.

Now back to Bloc! I had a bit of foreknowledge from various courses on udemy, codeacademy and the like. The first three weeks weren't that much of a challenge. But still, it was intense, because I never had to dedicate my time to a program. I coded when I felt to. So it basically was an acclimatization into the huge world of coding. In week four I had a technical interview with the head of curriculum at Bloc and it was a whole new different feeling. I'm comfortable in my english skills but talking about functions, objects, closures... Describing the what and the why was difficult but I did a good job and went on to the next episode in my Bloc experience.
