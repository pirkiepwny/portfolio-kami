title: My road to an online bootcamp
---
My journey into development actually began quite early in my early teenage years. I was obsessed with computers and especially computer games. My goals as a little teenage boy always were to get a job, where I can be with my beloved computer all day long. Programming was always fascinating to me, so it was, a very neat choice. 

In the age of 13, I purchased two programming books. One for html and css and the other one was a php book i guess. What can I say. I was inspired, but it definitely wasn't something I was expecting. With the goal of making a browser game in little to no time i quickly came back to reality to see that this is not gonna happen! My teenage dreams were crushed. 

I was always hungry to learn about new technologies, always wanting the newest phones, graphics cards, headphones etc. One day I stumbled across codeacademy. Took a bunch of their soft intro-courses. At this day I was 20 and serving for the military. I was back the game! I had fun . A lot of fun actually. Went over to udemy, another online learning platform to get my hands dirty. 

Tried Ruby, Rails, Python, Html, Css, Basic Js, even C# , where I was trying to develop a game in unity. Unfortunately I never really digged deeper into the materia. I was overwhelmed . I did basic scripts in a variety of lenguages. I was scared and fascinated at the same time. Escpecially web development was so interesting, because you use so much different stuff to build. Technology changes rapidly and love learning new stuff.  I want variety, I love variety ! That was the moment where I knew that this is the perfect fit for me. But how do I get there ?

Discovering bootcamps:

March, 2016. That's the time where I was discovering bootcamps. They were intense and guided and offer a high success rate to find a job. Well, not bad I thought. The problem was, in person bootcamps were too expensive.  They cost a fortune and in addition you needed to go to the US or the Uk for example and pay extra for living for the few months there. I was looking at alternatives in Austria. Basically what I discovered and learned is that I was better off saving money and learning on my own . 

Suddenly I discovered online bootcamps . I found Bloc, and a whole lot of others. Went to an online info session and this was the moment I fell in love with it . You basically get a mentor from the industry meeting and working with you two times a week and superb support through email, slack on basically every day of the week. Done deal!


I will update my experiences with bloc and with my personal journey into the programming world in future posts.
